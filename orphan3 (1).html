<h1>Orphanages in Guntur and their contacts</h1>
<p>

There are children who are employed as child labourers in factories, shops and hotels while others also work as scavengers to earn a living for their families. What is the meaning of childhood for them?
Well, their future is bright if you onsider the work being carried out by some social service organizations of Guntur in the field of education and health, thus saving the children from adopting any bad habits or being exploited by unscrupulous elements.
